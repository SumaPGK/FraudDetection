# FraudDetection

•	Developed a classification model using logistic regression and random forest classifier to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent credit card transactions.
•	Achieved an accuracy of 96% utilizing cross validation, standard scaler, PCA transformation and several other techniques. 
•	Plotted AUC to evaluate performance of each model which is more suitable than confusion matrix for an imbalance dataset with less than 1% of fraudulent classes.
